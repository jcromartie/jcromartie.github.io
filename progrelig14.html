    <p>
      The Google Docs form will be open for responses until Friday May
       2, 2014. After that point, I will do final analysis and publish
       the results at a page on this site.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Programmers are a notoriously anti-establishment bunch, with
      religious views being no exception. There are abundant
      stereotypes of the crotchety atheist programmer with a Flying
      Spaghetti Monster emblem on his car, or the crunchy-granola type
      who prefers some form of neo-pagan practice.</p>

    <p>But what is the real spiritual (or lack thereof) makeup of the
      programming community, and, within the community, how do
      specific beliefs relate to one another and to factors such as
      experience, education, and preferred tools?</p>

    <p>We know that language shapes thought, but how far does the
      impact go when it comes to what many percieve to be practical
      everyday tools, such as programming languages?</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>I seek to illustrate the basic religious makeup of the
      programming community, broken down along several lines, as
      compared to the general (Internet) population. I also want to be
      able to present some interesting correlations, if any are to be
      found, from the data.</p>

    <p>The ultimate end result will be an interactive document,
      produced using <a href="http://d3js.org">D3.js</a>, that will
      allow users to explore the survey results, and plot various
      answers relative to another.</p>
